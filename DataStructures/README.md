DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS

CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW : SUMMARY

A data structure is the organization of data in a computer's memory or in a disk file.
The correct choice of data structure allows major improvements in program efficiency.
Examples of data structures are arrays, stacks and linked lists.
An algorithm is a procedure for carrying out a particular task.
In java, an algorithm is usually implemented by a class method.
Many of the data structures and algorithms described in this book are most often used to build databases.
Some data structures are used as programmer's tools: They help execute an algorithm.
Other data structures model real-world situation, such as telephone lines running between cities.
A database is a unit of data storage composed of many similar records.
A record often represents a real-world object, such as an employee or a car part.
A record is divided into fields. Each field stores one characteristic of the object described by the record.
A key is a field in a record that's used to carry out some operation on the data. For example, personnel records might be sorted by a LastName field.
A database can be searched for all records whose key field has a certain value. This value is called a search key.
